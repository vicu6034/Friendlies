Friendlies.dll (WIP)

Current Features:
- 4 new Bow attacks to be applied to NPC's
- An Axe you can jump and lunge with (the knife secondary animation)
- Special Groot companion with custom attacks
- Bonus NPC cfg to make effective use of new Bow attacks
- Necromancer and Dvorah NPCs that spawn custom Skeletons and Deathquitos
- WIP Mage

Planned Features:
- Many, many more attacks that are not typically posisible through RRR configs
  - Mostly for NPCs, but some will work for the player if you want to mess with them
- Fully custom-made NPC-AI to be used with MobAILib (branched into seperate repo)
- More companions

Known Issues:
- CombatOverhaul throws some errors, doesnt look like it effects anything besides not applying its changes to the custom attacks.

TO WORK ON (END OF 5/13):
- Remove pink and red from Groot
- Rewrite AxeJump to work for NPCs
- Make minisquitos smaller and quieter
- Mage attacks
